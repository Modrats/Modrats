I'm a determined engineer fueled by caffeine, curiosity, and the occasional debugging victory dance. 
From crafting AI-driven systems (yes, I talk to LLMs for a living) to tinkering with generative AI and cloud-based architectures, I'm all about solving real-world problems with a sprinkle of tech magic. 

When Iâ€™m not knee-deep in code, you can find me dreaming up new ways to break (and fix) things.

Letâ€™s build something awesome togetherâ€”or at least trade memes. ðŸ’»âœ¨
